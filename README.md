## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve GitLearn! Here's how you can help:

### Adding or Editing Commands

Git command content is stored in JavaScript arrays within `index.html`:

1. Open `index.html` in a text editor
2. Find the script tag at the bottom of the file
3. Locate the appropriate array:
   - `const commands = [...]` - Curated list for the main command reference
   - `const allGitCommands = [...]` - Complete list for the "All Commands" page

#### Command Structure

```javascript
{
    command: 'git [command] [args]',      // Primary command display
    category: 'setup',                    // Categorization
    description: "Brief description",     // Clear explanation of functionality
    syntax: 'git [command] [options]',    // Full syntax
    example: 'git [command] --option-a\n  git [command] --option-b', // Examples
    vsCode: "VS Code usage instructions"  // IDE-specific guidance (allGitCommands only)
}
```

#### Categories

**Main Commands (`commands` array):**
- `setup` - Configuration and initialization
- `snapshotting` - Basic staging and committing
- `branching` - Branch and merge operations
- `remote` - Remote repository management
- `undoing` - Reverting changes
- `history` - Inspection and history
- `advanced` - Complex operations

**All Commands (`allGitCommands` array):**
- `setup` - Setup & Configuration
- `project` - Getting & Creating Projects
- `snapshotting` - Basic Snapshotting
- `branching` - Branching & Merging
- `sharing` - Sharing & Updating Projects
- `inspection` - Inspection & Comparison
- `undoing` - Undoing Things
- `advanced` - Advanced Commands
- `collaboration` - Collaboration / Remote Management
- `plumbing` - Low-Level / Plumbing Commands

### Adding Quiz Questions

Quiz questions are managed in the `const quizData = [...]` array:

```javascript
{
    question: "Question text",
    answers: ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
    correct: "Option A"
}
```

After making changes, save the file and reload `index.html` in your browser to see the updates.
