Practice Git commands in an interactive terminal environment with simulated repository operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

GitLearn requires only a modern web browser to run:
- Google Chrome (recommended)
- Mozilla Firefox
- Apple Safari
- Microsoft Edge

No additional software installation or server setup is required.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Alternatively, download the `index.html` file directly.

2. **Launch the Application**
   Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

The application will load immediately with no additional configuration required.

## Application Architecture

| Component | Functionality |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Home** | Introduction to Git fundamentals and installation procedures |
| **Workflow** | Interactive 3D visualization of Git branching and merging workflows |
| **Commands** | Curated reference of essential Git commands with examples |
| **All Commands** | Complete reference documentation with detailed explanations |
| **IDEs** | Comprehensive guides for Git integration in popular IDEs |
| **Mastery** | Learning progression path and competency assessment tools |
| **Git Terminal** | Interactive terminal for practicing Git commands |

## Git Master Terminal

The Git Master Terminal is an interactive in-browser terminal that simulates real Git operations. Users can practice Git commands in a safe environment without affecting their actual repositories.

### Features

- **Realistic Terminal Interface** - Dark theme with monospace font for authentic developer experience
- **Command Simulation** - All key Git commands with realistic responses
- **Learning Missions** - Guided tutorials for common Git workflows
- **Command History** - Navigate through previous commands with up/down arrow keys
- **Virtual Repository** - Simulated repository state management

### Supported Commands

- `git init` - Initialize a new repository
- `git status` - Show working tree status
- `git add` - Add file contents to the index
- `git commit` - Record changes to the repository
- `git log` - Show commit logs
- `git branch` - List, create, or delete branches
- `git checkout` - Switch branches or restore working tree files
- `git merge` - Join two or more development histories
- `help` - Show available commands
- `mission` - Start a learning mission
- `clear` - Clear the terminal screen

### Learning Missions

1. **Initialize Repository** - Create a new Git repository and make your first commit
2. **Branching** - Create and merge a feature branch
3. **Collaboration** - Simulate working with remote repositories (coming soon)

## Technical Implementation

- **Core Technologies**: HTML5, ECMAScript 6, CSS3
- **Styling Framework**: Tailwind CSS (CDN-delivered)

- **UI Components**: Alpine.js for reactive interface elements
- **Deployment Model**: Single-file distribution with no external dependencies

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance GitLearn are welcome. Please follow these guidelines:

### Command Documentation

Git command content is maintained in JavaScript arrays within `index.html`:

1. Open `index.html` in a text editor
2. Navigate to the script section at the bottom of the file
3. Locate the appropriate command array:
   - `const commands = [...]` - Primary command reference
   - `const allGitCommands = [...]` - Extended command documentation

#### Command Object Structure

```javascript
{
    command: 'git [command] [args]',      // Primary command identifier
    category: 'setup',                    // Functional categorization
    description: "Brief description",     // Concise functionality explanation
    syntax: 'git [command] [options]',    // Complete syntax specification
    example: 'git [command] --option-a\n  git [command] --option-b', // Practical examples
    vsCode: "VS Code usage instructions"  // IDE-specific guidance (allGitCommands only)
}
```

#### Command Categories

**Primary Commands (`commands` array):**
- `setup` - Configuration and initialization procedures
- `snapshotting` - Staging and committing operations
- `branching` - Branch management and merging
- `remote` - Remote repository operations
- `undoing` - Change reversal mechanisms
- `history` - Commit history inspection
- `advanced` - Complex Git operations

**Extended Commands (`allGitCommands` array):**
- `setup` - Setup & Configuration
- `project` - Project initialization and cloning
- `snapshotting` - Basic Snapshotting
- `branching` - Branching & Merging
- `sharing` - Repository sharing and updates
- `inspection` - Code inspection and comparison
- `undoing` - Change reversal operations
- `advanced` - Advanced Git functionality
- `collaboration` - Collaborative development tools
- `plumbing` - Low-level Git operations

### Adding Quiz Questions

Quiz questions are managed in the `const quizData = [...]` array with the following structure:

```javascript
{
    question: "Question text",
    answers: ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
    correct: "Option A"
}
```

### Extending the Git Master Terminal

To add new commands to the Git Master Terminal:

1. Locate the `commands` object in the terminal logic section
2. Add a new command object with the following structure:

```javascript
commandName: {
    description: "Brief description of the command",
    usage: "commandName [options]",
    execute: function(args) {
        // Implementation of the command logic
        // Use printOutput() to display results
        // Use addToHistory() to add commands to history
    }
}
```

After implementing changes, save the file and refresh `index.html` in your browser to verify updates.
