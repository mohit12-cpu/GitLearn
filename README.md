GitLearn: Interactive Git & VS Code Guide

This is a single-file, interactive front-end website designed to teach users Git commands, common workflows, and integration with IDEs like Visual Studio Code.

The entire application is contained within index.html. It uses HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS (loaded via CDN) to create a multi-page feel, an interactive terminal emulator, quizzes, and 3D workflow visualisations.

Features

Single-File Application: The entire website (HTML, CSS, JS) is in index.html.

Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS, the site is usable on desktop and mobile.

SPA-like Navigation: JavaScript is used to show/hide sections, simulating a multi-page website without page reloads.

3D Workflow Visualisation: A (beta) 3D graph built with Three.js visualises branching, committing, and merging in real-time.

Comprehensive Command Reference: A searchable and filterable list of common and advanced Git commands.

Interactive Terminal: A simulated terminal emulator lets users "try out" commands and see fake (but realistic) output.

IDE Integration Guides: Content explaining how to use Git within VS Code and JetBrains IDEs, complete with placeholder screenshots.

Git Mastery Quiz: A simple, dynamic quiz to test user knowledge.

Dark Mode: Includes a dark mode toggle that respects the user's system preference (prefers-colour-scheme).

Website Structure (Sections in index.html)

<section id="home">: Introduction to Git and an installation guide.

<section id="workflow">: Features the 3D interactive workflow visualisation and explains the basic Git cycle (init, add, commit, etc.).

<section id="commands">: The main command reference page. All content is dynamically generated by JavaScript from the commands array.

<section id="ides">: A tabbed guide for using Git in VS Code and JetBrains IDEs.

<section id="mastery">: A "Learning Path" overview and the interactive Git quiz.

<div id="terminal-emulator">: A modal overlay that contains the terminal simulation.

How to Run Locally

Since this is a single-file application, there is no build step.

Clone or Download:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>

OR, simply download the index.html file.

Open in Browser:

Open the index.html file directly in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

That's it! The website will run locally.

How to Contribute (Add/Edit Commands)

The Git command content is not hard-coded in the HTML. It's stored in a JavaScript array to make it modular and easy to edit.

Open index.html in a text editor.

Find the commands array: Scroll down to the main <script> tag at the bottom of the file. You will find a large constant variable named const commands = [...].

Add a new command:
Add a new object to the commands array, following this structure:

{
    command: 'git [command] [args]', // The primary command display
    category: 'setup', // Must be one of: setup, snapshotting, branching, remote, undoing, history, advanced
    description: "A brief, clear description of what the command does.",
    syntax: 'git [command] [options]', // The full syntax
    example: 'git [command] --option-a\ngit [command] --option-b' // \n for new lines
}


Edit an existing command:
Find the command's object in the commands array and modify its properties.

Save the file and reload index.html in your browser to see the changes.

The same process applies for adding new quiz questions to the const quizData = [...] array.
